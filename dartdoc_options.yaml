# Dartdoc configuration for this package.
#
# Rationale:
# Public API is exposed through a curated `iwb_canvas_engine.dart` entrypoint
# with selective
# re-exports (`show` lists). Keeping low-confidence ambiguous reexport scoring
# suppresses noisy warnings for intentionally-curated export graphs.
