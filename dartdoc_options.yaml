# Dartdoc configuration for this package.
#
# Rationale:
# This package intentionally provides two public entrypoints:
# - `basic.dart` (recommended minimal API)
# - `advanced.dart` (full API surface)
#
# Both entrypoints re-export a shared subset of symbols by design, which causes
# dartdoc to emit "ambiguous reexport" warnings. We keep the two-entrypoint
# structure and silence that specific warning category.
